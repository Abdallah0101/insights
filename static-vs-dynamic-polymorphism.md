In C++, you have two main kinds of polymorphism: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. Each works differently and is used in different situations.

**Compile-Time Polymorphism**

Compile-time polymorphism (also known as static polymorphism) is resolved during the compilation process. This means the compiler decides which function or operator to use based on the code you write. Common techniques for achieving compile-time polymorphism include:

- **Function Overloading:** Multiple functions can have the same name as long as their parameter lists are different. The compiler picks the right version based on the arguments you provide.
- **Operator Overloading:** You can define how operators (like `+` or `-`) work for your custom types.
- **Templates:** Templates allow you to write functions or classes that work with any data type. The compiler generates the specific code needed when you use the template with a particular type.

For example, consider function overloading:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void print(int x) {
    cout << "Integer: " << x << endl;
}

void print(double x) {
    cout << "Double: " << x << endl;
}

int main() {
    print(5);      // The compiler chooses print(int)
    print(3.14);   // The compiler chooses print(double)
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the decision about which `print` function to call is made when the program is compiled. This makes the process efficient, with no extra decision-making needed during program execution.

**Runtime Polymorphism**

Runtime polymorphism (or dynamic polymorphism) is determined while the program is running. This allows your code to decide which function to execute based on the actual object type, even when you're working with a pointer or reference to a base class. To achieve runtime polymorphism in C++, you use virtual functions along with inheritance.

Hereâ€™s an example using virtual functions:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    // Declaring speak() as virtual allows derived classes to override it
    virtual void speak() {
        cout << "Animal speaks" << endl;
    }
    
    // A virtual destructor is important for proper cleanup
    virtual ~Animal() = default;
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() override {
        cout << "Dog barks: Woof!" << endl;
    }
};

class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() override {
        cout << "Cat meows: Meow!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create pointers of type Animal* but pointing to different derived objects
    Animal* pet1 = new Dog();
    Animal* pet2 = new Cat();
    
    // The correct speak() method is chosen at runtime based on the actual object type
    pet1->speak();  // Outputs: Dog barks: Woof!
    pet2->speak();  // Outputs: Cat meows: Meow!
    
    delete pet1;
    delete pet2;
    return 0;
}
```

In this case, even though both `pet1` and `pet2` are of type `Animal*`, the program decides at runtime which `speak()` method to call. This flexibility lets you write code that works with a common interface (the base class) while the actual behavior is determined by the derived class.

**Key Differences Explained in Words**

- **Decision Time:**  
  In compile-time polymorphism, decisions (such as which overloaded function to call) are made during compilation. In runtime polymorphism, the decision is deferred until the program is running, allowing for more flexible behavior.

- **Performance and Overhead:**  
  Compile-time polymorphism has little to no runtime overhead because all decisions are made before the program runs. Runtime polymorphism, on the other hand, involves a small overhead due to the dynamic lookup of virtual functions during execution.

- **Flexibility:**  
  Compile-time polymorphism is very efficient but less flexible. It works best when all types and behaviors are known at compile time. Runtime polymorphism is more flexible, allowing your program to work with objects of different classes through a common interface, even if those classes are defined later or loaded dynamically.

- **Use Cases:**  
  Use compile-time polymorphism for scenarios like arithmetic operations, sorting algorithms, or any situation where the types are known in advance. Use runtime polymorphism when designing systems that need to handle different behaviors based on object types, such as in graphical user interfaces or plugin systems.

**Recap**

- **Compile-Time Polymorphism:** Decisions are made during compilation using techniques like function overloading, operator overloading, and templates. It is efficient with no extra overhead at runtime.
- **Runtime Polymorphism:** Decisions are made during execution using virtual functions and inheritance. It allows your code to determine the appropriate behavior based on the actual type of an object at runtime, offering more flexibility with a slight performance cost.
